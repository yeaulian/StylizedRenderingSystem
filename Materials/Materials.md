# Materials
In SRS, materials can be used to define certain aspects of how the material is shaded:
- highlight and rimlight size in % of the maximum highlight size specified in the [SRS actor](../Blueprints/BP_StylizedRenderingSystem.md). 
- shading as metallic or non-metallic
- the pattern which gets applied to shadows, highlights and rimlights.

Additionally, for translucent materials, you may customize many more aspects such as:
- the gradients that fade your shadows, highlights and rimlights in and out
- all pattern background settings

This is the documentation for the master materials that are shipped with SRS.
