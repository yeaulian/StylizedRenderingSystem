# Materials
In SRS materials can be used to define certain aspects of how the material is shaded:
- highlight and rimlight size in % of the maximum highlight size specified in the [SRS actor](../Blueprints/BP_StylizedRenderingSystem.md). 
- shading as metallic or non-metallic
- the pattern which gets applied to shadows, highlights and rimlights.

This is the documentation for the materials that are shipped with SRS.
